This repository contains a simple C program that exhibits unexpected behavior when a variable is modified indirectly through a pointer. The `bug.c` file demonstrates the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.c` provides the corrected version.  The issue highlights a subtle but important aspect of pointer usage in C.  This example is useful for learning about pointer arithmetic and memory management in C.
